Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.
(Not to be confused with a WordPress framework â€“ Redux Framework.)

It helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test. On top of that, it provides a great developer experience, such as live code editing combined with a time traveling debugger.
